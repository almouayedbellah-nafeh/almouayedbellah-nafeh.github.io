[Al Mouayed Bellah Nafeh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/al-mouayed-bellah-nafeh/) (1993), graduated from the University of Balamand, Lebanon in 2015 with a B.Sc. in Civil and Environmental Engineering following a thesis in Finite Element Analysis of Structural Steel Elements. He worked briefly on infrastructure and residential high-rise projects in Lebanon. He graduated from the European Commission’s Erasmus Mundus [MEEES](https://www.preventionweb.net/resource/erasmus-master-earthquake-engineering-and/or-engineering-seismology-meees) programme in 2017 with a M.Sc. in Geomechanics, Civil Engineering and Risks and Earthquake Engineering and Engineering Seismology after attending courses in Université Grenoble-Alpes (France) and [IUSS Pavia](https://www.iusspavia.it/en) (Italy), respectively, followed by a thesis on Numerical Homogenization Techniques for Concrete. Subsequently, he pursued a two-year research fellowship at the Università degli studi di Pavia and IUSS Pavia funded by the [ReLuis](https://www.reluis.it/en/) and [ITERATE](https://civil-protection-humanitarian-aid.ec.europa.eu/funding-evaluations/financing-civil-protection/prevention-and-preparedness-projects-civil-protection/overview-past-track-i-and-track-ii-projects/improved-tools-disaster-risk-mitigation-algeria-iterate_en) consortia. Currently, his research addresses the quantification of seismic demand in existing infilled RC structures conditioned on the mean annual frequency of collapse and monetary losses due to earthquake. Research interests include: performance-based engineering, seismic assessment of existing RC structures, nonlinear modelling and analysis, risk assessment, loss assessment, regional portfolio assessment.
