[Al Mouayed Bellah Nafeh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/al-mouayed-bellah-nafeh/) (1993), graduated from the [University of Balamand](https://www.balamand.edu.lb/home/Pages/default.aspx), Lebanon in 2015 with a B.Sc. in Civil and Environmental Engineering following a thesis in Finite Element Analysis of Structural Steel Elements. He worked briefly on infrastructure and residential high-rise projects in Lebanon. He graduated from the European Commission’s Erasmus Mundus [MEEES](https://www.preventionweb.net/resource/erasmus-master-earthquake-engineering-and/or-engineering-seismology-meees) programme in 2017 with a M.Sc. in Earthquake Engineering and Engineering Seismology after attending courses in [Université Grenoble-Alpes](https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/) (France) and [IUSS Pavia](https://www.iusspavia.it/it) (Italy) followed by a thesis on Numerical Homogenization Techniques for Concrete. Subsequently, he pursued a two-year research fellowship at the Università degli studi di Pavia and IUSS Pavia funded by the [ReLuis](https://www.reluis.it/en/), [ITERATE](https://civil-protection-humanitarian-aid.ec.europa.eu/funding-evaluations/financing-civil-protection/prevention-and-preparedness-projects-civil-protection/overview-past-track-i-and-track-ii-projects/improved-tools-disaster-risk-mitigation-algeria-iterate_en) and [Infra-NAT](https://www.eucentre.it/progetto-infra-nat/) consortia. He was also involved in the [ROSSINI](https://progetto-rossini.it/) project as research associate during his doctoral studies. Currently, his research addresses the quantification of seismic demand in existing infilled RC structures conditioned on the mean annual frequency of collapse and monetary losses due to earthquake. Research interests include: performance-based engineering, seismic assessment of existing RC structures, nonlinear modeling and analysis, risk assessment.

Primary research interests include the seismic design and assessment of structures to incorporate innovative aspects of performance-based earthquake engineering; the seismic vulnerability of existing structures and ways to quantify the associated seismic risk and the direct monetary losses (both structural and non-structural). Current research addresses the derivation of efficient engineering demand parameters to account for damage accumulation in reinforced concrete structures due to the in-plane and out-of-plane interaction and the regional assessment of building portfolio using more efficient intensity measures through the generation of ShakeMaps validated using empirical data.
