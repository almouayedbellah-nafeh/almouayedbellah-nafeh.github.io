## Research Project Coordination
***Project:	Progetto Dipartimenti di Eccellenza 2023-2027***\
**Period:** Jan 2023 – Dec 2027\
**Role:**	Deputy Coordinator (Line R1)\
**Budget:**	€6,650,000\
**Funding:**	Italian Ministry of University and Research (MUR)\
**Description:**\
  The development of a risk-based approach for the sustainable design of structures and infrastructures with particular regard to those of protection from natural disasters and the sustainable development of the nation.

***Project:	ERIES: Engineering Research Infrastructures for European Synergies***\
**Webpage:** [www.eries.eu](https://www.eries.eu)\
**Period:** Jun 2022 – May 2026\
**Role:**	Project Coordinator\
**Budget:**	€11,616,118.24\
**Funding:**	European Commission Horizon Europe\
**Description:**\
  ERIES provides transnational access to advanced experimental facilities in the fields of structural, seismic, wind and geotechnical engineering, with new and unique infrastructures available for the first time. It allows users to advance frontier knowledge and conduct curiosity-driven research towards the reduction of losses and disruption due to these hazards, the management of their associated risk, and the development of innovative solutions to address them that will contribute to a greener and more sustainable society. The project comprises 13 partners from 8 different countries across Europe and North America, including: IUSS Pavia (Italy, Coordinator), Eucentre Foundation (Italy); University of Patras (Greece); Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (Greece); Laboratório Nacional de Engenharia Civil (LNEC), Lisbon (Portugal); Centre de recherche (CEA) Paris-Saclay (France); University of Bristol (United Kingdom); Institute of Earthquake Engineering and Engineering Seismology (IZIIS), Skopje (N. Macedonia); University of Genova (Italy); Western University (Canada); Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e), Eindhoven (Netherlands); Centre Scientifique et Technique du Bâtiment (CSTB) Nantes (France); European Laboratory for Structural Assessment, Ispra (Italy).

***Project:	ROSSINI: Progettazione, realizzazione e sperimentazione di un sistema prototipale di navigazione risk-aware per la gestione e mitigazione del RischiO SiSmico in industrie a rischio di INcidente rIlevante***\
**Webpage:** [www.progetto-rossini.it](https://www.progetto-rossini.it)\
**Period:** Jun 2020 – Nov 2022\
**Role:**	Principal Investigator and Coordinator\
**Budget:**	€333,300\
**Funding:**	Italian National Institute for Insurance against Accidents at Work (INAIL)\
**Description:**\
  ROSSINI places itself within the overall field of seismic risk-aware navigation systems. It describes the use of a sensor array for the integrated risk-aware navigation in industrial plants at risk of NaTech accidents, using an industrial plant facility in Italy as its pilot study. The integration of structural and environmental risks estimated and measured in different ways via a sensor array network is presented as part of an integrated risk identification and evaluation (RIE) module. This module is used to combine and map the possible risks spatially within an industrial plant’s layout and shown how this information can then be used to not only compute the safest path to safety for a worker located within such a plant but also how mobile communications can be used to aid and guide them in different scenarios.

***Project:	Progetto Dipartimenti di Eccellenza 2018-2022***\
**Period:** Jan 2019 – Jun 2022\
**Role:**	Deputy Coordinator (Line 3)\
**Budget:**	€8,205,100\
**Funding:**	Italian Ministry of University and Research (MUR)\
**Description:**\
  The research activities associated with Line 3 envisaged a complete review of available seismic design and assessment methods currently employed. It focussed on issues related to problems with current code-based approaches and aimed to incorporate avant-garde approaches such as risk-based and loss-driven approaches in order to promote and more optimal use of available resources in the future with the overall goal of reducing seismic risk.

***Project:	INFRA-NAT – Increased Resilience of Critical Infrastructure under Natural and Human-induced Hazards***\
**Webpage:** [www.infra-nat.eu](http://www.infra-nat.eu/)\
**Period:** Jan 2018 – Dec 2019\
**Role:**	Deputy Coordinator and Research Collaborator\
**Budget:**	€762,839.05\
**Funding:**	European Commission – Directorate-General for European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (DG-ECHO)\
**Description:**\
  The objective of the project was to assess the seismic vulnerability of roadway networks taking into account ageing and deterioration effects of their bridge structures. It focussed on the collection of structure data in Italy, Israel and North Macedonia with the aim of engaging local practitioners and authorities to encourage the adoption of such assessment and prioritisation methodologies.
