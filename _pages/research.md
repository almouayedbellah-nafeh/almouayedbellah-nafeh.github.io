## Research Interests

Primary research interests include the seismic design and assessment of structures to incorporate innovative aspects of performance-based earthquake engineering; the seismic vulnerability of existing structures and ways to quantify the associated seismic risk and the direct monetary losses (both structural and non-structural). Current research addresses the derivation of efficient engineering demand parameters to account for damage accumulation in reinforced concrete structures due to the in-plane and out-of-plane interaction and the regional assessment of building portfolio using more efficient intensity measures through the generation of ShakeMaps validated using empirical data.
